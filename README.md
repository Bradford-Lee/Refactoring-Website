# homework-01

## Description

The motivation for this project was to complete the challenge of the on-the-job ticket type of environment. This homework challenge allows us to practice the use of agile project management and prepare us for the workflow we would experience in a professional environment. We built this project to optimize the website for Horiseon, a marketing agency company. I learned to refactor existing code which improves the organization of the code without changing what the outputs are.
